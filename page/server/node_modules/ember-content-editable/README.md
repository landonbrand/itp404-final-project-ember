# ember-content-editable

Ember cli content-editable component, with placeholder and value binding. Use it just like an `input` or `textarea`, but it will autoresize for you. It also works in [almost all browsers](http://caniuse.com/contenteditable).

## Installation

`ember install ember-content-editable`

## Usage

Use it just like `input` or `textarea`.

```javascript
{{content-editable value=name
                   placeholder="Your name"
                   type="text"}}
```

You can also pass in an extra CSS class if required, and of course specify the tag.

```javascript
{{content-editable value=name
                   placeholder="Your name"
                   class="name-field"
                   tagName="h3"}}
```

### Options

Option Name          | Description                                    | Default
---------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------
value                | The value to be edited                         | `""`
placeholder          | Placeholder displayed when value is blank      | `""`
stringInterpolator   | Function which processes / intercepts any updated value. Takes a string and returns the string to be used instead.           | none
class                | String with any extra css class               | none
type                 | `number`, `text`, or `html`. `text` strips out any html tags, `html` doesn't.                    | `html`
spellcheck           | Uses browsers spellcheck, same as with `<input>` | none
readonly             | If true, element can't be edited but is focusable | false
disabled             | If true, element can't be edited, focused or tabbed to | false
maxlength            | Maximum length of the input, in characters     | none
allowNewlines        | If false, linebreaks can't be entered          | true
autofocus            | If true, the element will be focused once inserted into the document | false
clearPlaceholderOnFocus | If true, the placeholder will be cleared as soon as the element gains focus (even if no content is present yet) | false

##### isText Deprecation
isText has been deprecated. You should replace `isText=true` with `type="text"`, and `isText=false` with `type="html"`.

##### editable Deprecation
`editable` has been deprecated in favour of `disabled` to be more consistent with
standard input tags.

### Events
You can provide actions to handle the following list of events. Arguments passed to your action are consistent with Ember implementations in places like the `{{input}}` helper. `value` is the current value of the content-editable field, `component` is the component instance itself, and `event` is the corresponding raw event object.

| Event Name     | Arguments
|----------------|----------------
| key-up         | value, event
| key-down       | value, event
| key-press      | component, event
| escape-press   | component, event
| enter          | component, event
| insert-newline | component, event
| focus-in       | component, event
| focus-out      | component, event
| mouse-enter    | component, event
| mouse-leave    | component, event

For example:
```javascript
{{content-editable value=name
                   placeholder="Your name"
                   enter="save"}}
```

### Customizing Placeholder Color
```
.ember-content-editable:empty {
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
}
```

## Common Problems
These are some solutions to common problems browsers have with contenteditable elements.

### Filtering Input
If you want to filter the input, you can achieve this using the `key-press` event.

The following example filters the input to only allow numerical values.

```
{{content-editable value=age key-press=filter}}
```

```
  filter(currentValue, event) {
    const keyCode = event.which;
    if (keyCode <= 48 || keyCode >= 58) {
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  },
```

### Extra Tags
Some browsers have a bug where extra tags including `<div>`s get inserted into contenteditable fields, usually when newlines are entered.

1) If you don't care about any tags, use `type="text"` to strip all of them.
2) If you do care about tags, either use `display: inline-block` on the content-editable component (simplest solution) or pass a function as `stringInterpolator=myInterpolator` to remove extra text.

```
myInterpolator(inputString) {
  /* Remove extra tags */
  return stringWithNoDivs;
}
```

### Tab Index
The `tabindex` attribute is bound to the element in the DOM, but only [certain tags support it](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex).

>The following elements support the tabindex attribute: A, AREA, BUTTON, INPUT, OBJECT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA.

So to use `tabindex`, you'll also need to set `tagName` to one of those.

### Newlines aren't showing
Try using `whitespace: pre-line;` or `whitespace: pre-wrap;` in your CSS.

### I can't blur the element
A solution to this is to call `window.getSelection().removeAllRanges()` after you call `blur()` on the element.

For example, if you have `enter='endEditing'` on your content-editable, the following action would prevent the newline and blur the element.

```
endEditing(contentEditable, event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  contentEditable.element.blur();
  window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
}
```

### Cursor appears too big when element is empty
Setting `display: block;` in CSS seems to solve this.
